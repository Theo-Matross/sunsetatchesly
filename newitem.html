            As the sun set and the ginger in my tea tingled my tongue, he told me all about his vision; ever edge, every crease, every hope,
every fear and every detail. Even as the light faded, I could see it clearly; the solution to the problem
gnawing at Kenyan football. There was a disconnect in the industry, a lack of emotion. More kenyans watched English Football 
than those that enjoyed local football. I myself dreamt of watching an Arsenal game all the way in London but did 
not care if Ulinzi Football Club lost or won. And so that was the genesis of long conversations every couple of days about
creating a website to provide access to the stats, some of which were alrady there but not digitized. Others stats still had to be collected.
Rudimentally, this move was and still is meant to add some feeling to kenyan football; the one that makes you look foward to watching a certain player ball out on
the pitch. The reason this project is dear to me is because its more than just a website; it's a foundation, it's a community of
players, fans and the clubs themselves.(explain how its more than just a website) 

I still remember being pitched the idea to and how it felt like an injection of adrenaline, a surge of life, a gust of fresh sweet air.
It had been a unclear for quite a while what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be.Ergo it was like quenching a thirst and I loved doing the project every single day 
of the four months.He invited me as a partner to share in his dream which he told of so much that it became part of mine.
